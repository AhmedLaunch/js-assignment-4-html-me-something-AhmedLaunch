         <h1>An Art Installation: Combining Two of My Passions</h1>
         <h2 style="text-align:left;"> Passion:1</h2>
         <p> I have spent over a decade working in the restaurant industry which gave me the oppurtnity to be able to
            understand, apprecaite and overall love what "food" really means. Its something that connects us all which 
            gives us a universal language into each others lives with out saying a word.
         </p>
         <h2 style="text-align:left;">Passion:2</h2>
         <p> While I didn't grow up with all the aesthetic oppurtnities, I, in my adult life
            have found an apprecation for "clothes" and fashion. What you wear can be an outlet for self-expression and
         self-identity. </p>
       
         <p> You're probably wondering what these two passion of mine have to do with each other, 
            well check out this new line of sneakers I created called:</p>
